# Multiple Linear Regression
Developed a linear regression function in RStudio that accommodates multiple outcome variables and    predictor sets while ensuring the validity of input data types and variable names. Implemented checks for missing data, excluding affected rows from analysis. Output included Î² coefficients, standard errors, R2, adjusted R2, as well as relevant statistics for t-tests and F-tests.

## Project Overview
Please create a function that will run multiple linear regression from first principles using ordinary least squares and linear algebra. This means that you will need to code the formulas for linear regression estimation from scratch. The minimum number of parameters of your function are:
1) Input dataset
2) Outcome variable
3) Multiple predictors (the number of predictors should be allowed to vary from application to application)

The minimum output should include the following:
a) Parameter estimates for all predictors  
b) Standard errors for all predictors  
c) R-squared goodness of fit measure
